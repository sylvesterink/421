Readme

To Compile:
    make

To Run:
    ProjectOne.exe [FILE NAME]
[FILE NAME] should be the name of the file that you would like to search through.

Description:
    The program outputs the name of the file searched, followed by the terms
    that were found in the file (operating room, operating system), or
    no match if neither term was found.

Notes:
    The attached executable is compiled for a 32-bit Linux system.

Extra:
    The following command will allow you to search all the text (.txt) files
    that are in the same directory as the executable. (Useful for batch
    testing.)
    for i in *.txt; do ./ProjectOne.exe $i; done
    This command assumes a Linux terminal.
